# ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ InstaChan WIP
a one file solution for image BBS ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
 ---
InstaChan is in no way a substitute for more robust bbs and chans-a-like.
But if you need a way to set a quick BBS for fell people it may just be your chan!
The premisses are as follow:
1) it is free, to use and mod, but if you do so, pls mention me ;)
2) it's a one file does it all project.... it's not meant to be fast or efficient, it's meant as a joke!
3) I do not that responsibility for any damage this peace os software may cause to you or to your system... you've been warned! o___o
4) this is not a serious board and it's meat as a quick and cheap way to setup a chan in your server.
5) This is just a study for a one file image board BBS using PHP and JSON.

Just upload this file to a php able server and watch it burn! ʕ￫ᴥ￩ʔ

Have fun...

## Getting started...
Just put the instachan.php file in a PHP able server and run it!
It'll run a first time setup and create the needed folder and files.
To reset just delete the .json files and it will be just as new ;)

to delete just delete every thing...
it's no rocket science... o___O
